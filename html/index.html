            NetLogo is a programmable modeling environment. It comes with a large library of existing simulations, both participatory and traditional, that you can use and modify. Content areas include social science and economics, biology and medicine, physics and chemistry, and mathematics and computer science. You and your students can also use it to build your own simulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.netlogoweb.org">In traditional NetLogo simulations</a>, the simulation runs according to rules that the simulation author specifies. HubNet adds a new dimension to NetLogo by letting simulations run not just according to rules, but by direct human participation.
          </p>
          <p>
            NetLogo was originally designed / created by <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/Uri.shtml">Uri Wilensky</a> and developed at <a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/">CCL</a>.

            HubNet simulations are based on a client/server architecture. The activity leader uses the NetLogo application to run a HubNet activity. When NetLogo is running a HubNet activity, we refer to it as a HubNet server. Participants use a client application to log in and interact with the HubNet server.
          </p>
          <p>
            While HubNet is only supported via the Java Desktop clients at the moment, we hope to add support for other types of clients such as tablets and phones in the future.
