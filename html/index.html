          NetLogo is a programmable modeling environment. It comes with a large library of existing simulations, both participatory and traditional, that you can use and modify. Content areas include social science and economics, biology and medicine, physics and chemistry, and mathematics and computer science. You and your students can also use it to build your own simulations.
          In traditional NetLogo simulations, the simulation runs according to rules that the simulation author specifies. HubNet adds a new dimension to NetLogo by letting simulations run not just according to rules, but by direct human participation.
          Since HubNet builds upon NetLogo, we recommend that before trying HubNet for the first time, you become familiar with the basics of NetLogo. To get started using NetLogo models, see Tutorial #1: Running Models in the NetLogo Users Manual.
