          <strong>HubNet Web</strong> is the latest evolution of the <a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/hubnet.html">HubNet technology for participatory simulations</a>, which typically take the form of something like brief, educational, multiplayer games.  HubNet Web re-imagines HubNet as a web application that runs in any modern web browser (including on Chromebooks and smartphones), allows user connections outside of the host's local area network, provides greater flexibility in user roles, and offers a more intuitive authoring experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          HubNet Web supports all of the simulations from the original HubNet's library of models, and more.  These simulations cover topics from social science to physics to biology to mathematics.  If none of the activities in the library suit your needs, you may also use <a href="/authoring">the HubNet Web authoring tool</a> to convert a model from <a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/">NetLogo</a> or <a href="https://netlogoweb.org/">NetLogo Web</a> into a HubNet Web activity, or even to build one entirely from scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
          NetLogo was originally designed by <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/Uri.shtml">Uri Wilensky</a> and developed at Northwestern University's <a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/">Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling (CCL)</a>.
